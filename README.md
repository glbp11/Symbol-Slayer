# Symbol Slayer
Symbol Slayer is a personal game I created where you defend yourself from monsters by drawing symbols onto a canvas to defeat them until the timer reaches zero.

# Details
The game was created in Unreal Engine 5.3. It is mostly made of C++ classes containing base functionality and Blueprints inheriting from them. The comparison of the symbols being drawn is done with the OpenCV library.

# How to play
Use your mouse to look around you to see which direction the enemies are coming from. In those directions there are also invisible canvases where you can hold down left click to start drawing onto it. Draw the symbol corresponding to the type of the enemy on the appropriate canvas to defeat the enemies. The closer the symbol is to the reference image shown in the tutorial the more damage you do.


# Build/Play
You will need Unreal Engine 5.3 installed in order to open the editor to play the game. Additionally the tree assets used are too large to upload, so you will have to download [Megascans Trees: European Hornbeam](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/megascans-trees-european-hornbeam-early-access?sessionInvalidated=true) to load the level properly in the editor. After that click the play button in the editor.
